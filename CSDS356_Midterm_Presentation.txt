Our Goal

To build a Python library that allows anyone to apply privacy preserving link prediction.

Link Prediction

Link prediction helps discover unobserved or latent connections between nodes in a graph
Data holders rank the likelihood of new connections forming overtime
Useful for social networks, e-commerce, telecomms, bioinformatics
Link Prediction
Data holders rank the likelihood of new connections forming overtime by calculating proximity scores and graph neural networks (GNNs)

Social Network: whether or not to recommend links between users
E-commerce: personalized ads, recommend products
Telecommunication: build optimal phone usage plans
Bioinfo: association between diseases or genes

Link prediction is typically done on a single local graph
Link prediction can be more accurate if we merge two or more graph databases that include similar information (Distributed Link Prediction)
Link Prediction
Advantage/how of link prediction

Two parties can utilize the connections in their combined graph to provide more accurate link predictions
In other cases, distributed link prediction allows link prediction between nodes based on other attributes
Distributed Link Prediction

In some cases, collaboration is mutually beneficial to contributing parties
In other cases, the second party is paid to participate
Distributed Link Prediction results in privacy concerns since it implies combining two or more different graph databases!

Privacy Preserving Link Prediction

Privacy preserving link prediction allows multiple data holders to collaboratively forecast unobserved or latent connections between nodes without explicitly revealing what each party knows.

Use Cases
Social Networks:
PPLP Used to understand the likelihood of a link between two nodes based on the similarity of these nodes in the different graphs. Here the nodes are people and the graphs represent a person’s knowledge of the given social network.
Telecommunication
Advertising company wants to use a telecom network or phone network for an advertisement. Using PPLP and a target audience x, they can find similar audience members for their advertisement based on x’s connections.
E-Commerce:
A product would be recommended to a user if they purchase similar products or similar users buy said product
Bioinformatics:
A graph of EHRs linking patients to a disease can be privately shared with a clustering graph to show if a disease is being spread within clusters / predict if a patient could have the disease

Common Neighbors Measure


Computes the number of common neighbors between two parties
More neighbors = Higher link likelihood
Fails to account for the relative amount of neighbors

Jaccard Measure
Computation of the relative amount of neighbors in common
This improves on the common neighbors measure

Adamic-Adar Measure

N(u) is the set of nodes adjacent to u
the sum of the log of the intersection of the neighbors of two nodes
Two-hop similarity helps to yield better results

Homomorphic Encryption
Homomorphic encryption allows for direct operations on encrypted data without knowing the contents of the encrypted data. This allows us to do Private Set Intersection as shown below:


Where:                                            X exists in Graph 1 and Graph 2 iff P(X) = 0
X is a fully homomorphically encrypted node in Graph 1
xi is node i in Graph 2
r is a random constant

Private Set Intersection
Private Set Intersection (PSI) protocols are the core of the privacy maintenance mechanisms used here
There are many different algorithms that leverage both Oblivious Transfer (OT) and Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), but OT is bottlenecked by communication complexity
Lattice Based Cryptography from Craig Gentry in 2009 made FHE a practical possibility and it makes it possible to do PSI fast and with low communication overhead when optimized.

And communication complexity makes it difficult to implement OT well

An ultra-fast Private Set Intersection (PSI) protocol built upon a novel, bucket-based Oblivious Key-Value Store (OKVS) and Vector Oblivious Linear Evaluation (VOLE). It utilizes a Bucket-Based Efficient Gaussian Elimination (BBEGE) algorithm to drastically speed up encoding.

Communication complexity is O(n) (linear with the input size), as the highly efficient OKVS achieves an incredibly low encoding redundancy of just 1% (meaning the encoded size m=1.01n).

This is the state-of-the-art "low-bandwidth" alternative that minimizes network communication overhead compared to previous leading protocols (like RR22, which had 30% redundancy). It comprehensively outperforms existing solutions in constrained network environments (e.g., 10 Mbps WAN) while supporting both semi-honest and malicious security settings.


Project Details

We’ll build a Python library that allows anyone to apply privacy preserving link prediction.

Implementation
This slide should highlight the "hybrid" nature of your library—prioritizing performance through C++ while maintaining accessibility through Python.
Core Backend (High Performance):
C++ Engine: Leverages the Ultra-Fast PSI protocol from Ling et al. (2025) which utilizes Vector Oblivious Linear Evaluation (VOLE) and Oblivious Key-Value Stores (OKVS) to achieve $O(n)$ communication complexity.
Cryptographic Primitives: Optimized implementations of Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) and Lattice-Based Cryptography to minimize communication overhead.
The Bridge (Python Bindings):
Pybind11 / Cython: Bridges the C++ backend to a user-friendly Python interface, allowing data scientists to run complex PPLP tasks without writing low-level code
User Interface (Front-End):Web App Interface: A React or Streamlit-based dashboard that allows users to upload graph snapshots and visualize predicted links.Visualization Engine: Interactive graph rendering to show latent and unobserved connections predicted by the library.
